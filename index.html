<h2>Getting Tickets & Picking The Shows</h2>
<p>If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn't
    so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I'm here to help you out. First, plan out
    which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie:
    SET A BUDGET. If you're worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you
    won't have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers
    you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!</p>

<h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>
<p>Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don't you'll be uncomfortable the
    whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and
    taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines. Also
    it's important to wear shoes you'll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to
    look good, but you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
